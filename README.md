### This repository contains projects that I have worked on before joining Uni.

###### (The links to the pages are yet to be added, need to put them on a hosting platform).
###### Also many of the images have to be resized, will be done in future version of this readme.

I have classified the projects into the following categories : 
1. Static Web-Sites
2. Interactive mini-apps
3. Full Stack Apps

## Full Stack App : elonSays REST API
I built this using HTML/CSS/Javascript in the front-end and NodeJS/Express in the back end. The project is not active at the moment.
However one can still check out the static home-page portion of the project.

## Interactive apps using JS
This is the section which I enjoyed working on the most. I made many of them while I was learning Javascript. Some larger projects taught me the importance of structuring in a large program. Here I am listing those projects from *most complex to simpler*.

## Static Web-Sites
Nothing much, just simple web-pages using vanilla HTML/CSS. These were made while I was learning the basics, so there will be errors. Also the responsive design is not perfect.
